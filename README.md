# Portfolio-Two



This is my portfolio where I will hightlight my acheivements. Once complete, my portfolio will have links to my projects and resume, as well as to my personal LinkedIn and GitHub sites. I will use this portfolio as I look for employment.

In my portfolio, I have applied the following core skills:
    * Flexbox
    * Media Queries
    * CSS Variables

Placeholder images have been used for me to showcase future deployed web applications.

Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

  * The navigation and footer bars have links to my professional sites including, GitHub and LinkedIn.
  * The user can click on the images of my applications, the user is taken to that deployed application.
